    "Background information:\n",
    "Trains are generally seen as an environmental friendly mode of transport. The European Union recently announced a plan to improve the railway network in Europe in order to reduce CO2 emissions . The trend of investing in railway transport begs the question whether those investments are effective. Because there is often a great amount of money involved in those investments, this research takes a deeper dive into the relationship between investments in the rail network for passengers and the usage of that train network. The goal is to create a visual overview of that relationship. The infrastructure investments are measured relative to the gross domestic product (GDP) of a country. \n",
