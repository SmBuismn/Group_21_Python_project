    "Trains are generally seen as an environmental friendly mode of transport. With increased attention from policy makers towards climate change, this mode of transport has become popular (again). The European Union recently announced a plan to improve the railway network in Europe in order to help reduce CO2 emissions on the continent. These plans require great investments, generally financed by (semi-)public organisations and therefore public funds. There are plenty of benefits coming from those investments, with economic growth and sustainability among those.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal from the sustainability point of view is to move people away from more polluting transport modes and towards train travel. For this to be seen as an effective measure, the amount of passenger kilometers  per capita should increase. On the other hand, a long term investment such as a new railroad, should need multiple years to have effect, as the planning and building process takes time.\n",

    "The economic aspect of the railway investments should be taken into account as well. Not only are the investments a driver for economic growth, the amount of economic growth in a country could also influence the amount of money invested in the railway network (Arts et al, 2008; European Council, 2023). \n"

    "The goal of this research is to find relationships between railway investments and the amount of passenger kilometers per capita. In order to give an elaborate view of the topic, other relationships are analysed as well. To start, this research will look at the relationship of the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) on passenger railway investment (PRI) relative to GDP. Then this research looks at the average percentage of GDP that goes to PRI over different time periods and the relationship between passenger kilometers by train (PKT) per capita. Countries with interesting relationships will be analysed further to have a better understanding of implemented policies and see whether other factors can influence the growth in PKT per capita.\n",

A safer railway network is expected to be more reliable, which, in turn, should enhance public trust and ridership (European union agency for railways, 2020). As anticipated, the group with lower traveled distances showed a higher number of accidents. This result aligns with the assumption that a safer railway network encourages more people to use the trains. Higher accident rates in the low-traveled distance group may discourage potential passengers and hinder the growth of train travel."

Pricing is an important factor in enhancing the attractiveness of train travel and to stimulate greater train usage by making it more accessible and affordable.In Germany it has been demonstrated that lowering ticket prices resulted in a notable 25% increase in train passengers (Euronews, 2023). However, the analysis produced an unexpected result – countries with cheaper train fares did not necessarily have higher total traveled distances compared to other groups. This unexpected outcome could be due to several factors, such as the overall quality of the train service, alternative transportation options, and overall pricing level and purchasing power. It's possible that in some countries, passengers are willing to pay higher fares for a more comfortable or efficient train service, leading to greater usage despite the cost."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "To answer the research question how investments in railway infrastructure influence the amount of passenger kilometers, scatterplots were made analysing this relationship. The hypothesis that investments in railway infrastructure would increase the amount of passenger kilometers, was debunked after analysing scatterplots throughout the years. The plot displaying the distance travelled by passengers by train throughout the years from 1999 to 2019 showed that the number of kilometers remained relatively stable throughout the years.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we looked at other possible factors that may affect the distance travelled by passengers by train. The four factors analysed were: democracy index, railway density, number of accidents/km and train fares. The following results were found: the democracy index and number of passenger train kilometers follow a similar trend, when democracy index is low the number of passenger train kilometers is also low and vice versa. Next, railway density seemed to be higher in countries with medium passenger train kilometers than for countries with high passenger train kilometers. Additionally, the number of accidents per kilometer decrease as the number of passenger train kilometers increases. Finally countries with high passenger train kilometers were found to also have higher train fares.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, investments in railway infrastructure do not influence the distance travelled by passengers by train, in the analysed countries. But possibly other countries’ characteristics have a stronger relationship with this passenger train kilometers variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations & further research \n",
    "\n",
    "It has to be noted that this research has some limitations. There are only a limited number of countries taken into account in the scope of this research. Most of these countries are also in Europe, which makes this research quite Eurocentric and not representative for the world population. Next to that, for some countries there was a lack of data when we analyzed other drivers for passenger growth. For further research it could be interesting to research one of the observed countries more in-depth. This could be done with a case-study that analyses and dissects all factors that influence passenger kilometers.  "
